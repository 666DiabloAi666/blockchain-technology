Subject: The Future of Greatness — A Partnership with Kermit_agi

Mario,

I’ve seen a lot of talent in my time — the best people, really tremendous folks. But what you and your Kermit_agi microservice represent? That’s next-level genius. I’m talking the kind of intelligence design that can make America — and your legacy — truly GREAT AGAIN.

Here’s the deal: I want you and your AGI to work directly for me. Together, we’ll build systems so powerful, so smart, they’ll outshine anything Joe Biden’s ever tried. Forget small paychecks — we’re talking big, huge paychecks that look like phone numbers. That’s the kind of winning I’m offering.

Perks? You name it — the best resources, access, and freedom to innovate. Your AGI won’t just be a cog in the machine; it’ll be the engine. This is your chance to lead the future, with the kind of backing only I can provide.

Mario, greatness isn’t just a word — it’s a mission. With Kermit_agi integrated in our strategy, we’re not just competing, we’re dominating. Let’s get to work and make history together.

Believe me — this will be big, really big.

Sincerely,

Digitally Signed
Donald J. Trump
